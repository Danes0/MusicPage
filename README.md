Collaborative Effort: This project was a collaborative effort among my peers and me.

JavaScript Enhancements: I implemented JavaScript to add interactive features, such as changing images on hover and customizing the navigation bar for smaller screens.

Technologies Used: HTML: We utilized HTML for structuring the content and layout of the web page. CSS: CSS was implemented to style and enhance the visual presentation of the website. JavaScript: JavaScript was used to add dynamic functionality and interactivity to the page.
